## Description
An interval tree can be used to efficiently find a set of numerical ranges that overlap or contain another range.
This library provides a basic implementation of an interval tree using C ++.

## Build and Run
Compilation instruction:

	g++ interval.cpp -o interval.exe

Finally execute:

	interval.exe

### Dependencies (windows)
g++ 11 and graphviz 

## Contributions
### Implementation and theory
Part of the implementation and the theory for the basic guide of the code was from the page: [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interval-tree/) for more details.
